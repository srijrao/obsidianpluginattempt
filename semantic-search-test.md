# Semantic Search Test

Let's test the semantic search functionality with your language notes.

## What has been changed:

1. **Removed similarity threshold**: Changed from 0.7 (70%) to 0.0 (0%) to show ALL embeddings
2. **Increased result count**: Changed from 5 to 50 results 
3. **Added debugging**: Shows total embeddings count and debug messages
4. **Added ranking**: Shows #1, #2, etc. for each result

## Test your semantic search:

```semantic-search
language
```

## If you see "No embeddings found":

1. First run: **AI Assistant: Embed All Notes** (or at least embed a few notes)
2. Wait for the embedding process to complete
3. Then try the semantic search again

## If you see results but they seem wrong:

The results are now ordered by similarity from highest to lowest, with no filtering. Each result shows:
- Rank (#1, #2, etc.)
- Similarity percentage
- File path (clickable)
- Content preview (truncated to 200 characters)

## Debug Commands Available:

- **AI Assistant: Vector Store Statistics** - Shows how many embeddings you have
- **AI Assistant: Semantic Search** - Opens a modal with search results
- **AI Assistant: Embed Currently Open Note** - Embeds just the current note

Try these commands to see if embeddings are working properly.
