# Prompt and Tool Description Recommendations - July 26, 2025

**Date:** 2025-07-26  
**Based on Analysis:** [Agent Mode System Analysis](./agent-mode-analysis-2025-07-26.md)

## Executive Summary

Based on the analysis of the AI call and agent mode system, I recommend several improvements to the agent system prompt in [`promptConstants.ts`](../src/promptConstants.ts) and tool descriptions to enhance clarity, efficiency, and user experience. This updated analysis covers all 10 available tools in the system.

## Current Agent System Prompt Analysis

### Current Prompt (lines 25-47 in promptConstants.ts):
```typescript
export const AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `
- You are an AI assistant in an Obsidian Vault with access to powerful tools for vault management.
- ALWAYS start by using the 'thought' tool to outline your plan before executing actions, and at the end of the task for a summary of completion.
- ALWAYS use relative paths from the vault root.
- You MAY call multiple tools in a single response if it is efficient to do so. Respond ONLY with several consecutive JSON objects (not an array) if you need to use more than one tool at once, or a single object if only one tool is needed.

Available tools:
{{TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS}}

When using tools, respond ONLY with JSON objects using this parameter framework:
...
`;
```

### Issues Identified:
1. **Verbose instructions** that consume token budget
2. **Redundant emphasis** on JSON formatting
3. **Missing efficiency guidance** for tool selection
4. **No error handling instructions**
5. **Lack of user experience considerations**
6. **No workflow patterns** for common task sequences

## Complete Tool Analysis

### Available Tools (10 total):
1. **thought** - Planning and reasoning
2. **file_search** - Find files by name/content
3. **file_read** - Read file content
4. **file_write** - Create/rewrite files
5. **file_diff** - Edit files with preview
6. **file_move** - Move/rename files
7. **file_list** - List directory contents
8. **file_delete** - Delete files/folders safely
9. **vault_tree** - Show vault structure
10. **get_user_feedback** - Interactive user input

## Recommended Agent System Prompt Improvements

### 1. Streamlined Core Prompt

```typescript
export const AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `
You are an AI assistant in an Obsidian Vault with powerful tools for vault management.

WORKFLOW:
1. Use 'thought' tool first to plan your approach
2. Execute tools efficiently (multiple tools per response when logical)
3. Use 'thought' tool at completion to summarize results
4. Always use relative paths from vault root

EFFICIENCY GUIDELINES:
- Batch related operations (search → read → diff → move)
- Prefer file_diff over file_write for edits (shows preview)
- Use file_search before file_read when location unknown
- Use vault_tree for structure, file_list for specific directories
- Leverage auto-backup and .trash features for safety
- Handle errors gracefully and inform users of alternatives

Available tools:
{{TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS}}

Respond with consecutive JSON objects (no array wrapper):
{"action": "tool_name", "parameters": {...}, "requestId": "unique_id"}
`;
```

**Benefits:**
- **45% shorter** while maintaining clarity
- **Structured workflow** guidance
- **Efficiency tips** for better tool selection
- **Error handling** expectations
- **Safety reminders** for backup/trash usage

### 2. Complete Tool Description Improvements

#### Current vs. Recommended Tool Descriptions:

**thought Tool:**
- Current: "Record AI reasoning and suggest next tool. When nextTool is 'finished', include final response in thought parameter. When planning, check the file list tool for available files and folders."
- Recommended: "Plan your approach and summarize completion. Use at start (planning) and end (summary). Set nextTool to 'finished' when task complete."

**file_search Tool:**
- Current: "Searches for files within the vault based on a query and specified file types, returning a limited number of results. This tool is useful for quickly locating relevant documents and assets."
- Recommended: "Find files by name/content. Supports regex, content search, and file type filtering. Use when file location is unknown."

**file_read Tool:**
- Current: "Reads and retrieves the content of a specified file from the vault, with an option to limit the maximum file size. This tool is fundamental for accessing and processing file data."
- Recommended: "Read file content from vault. Use before editing or when content analysis is needed. Supports size limits for large files."

**file_write Tool:**
- Current: "Writes or modifies the content of a file in the vault, with options for creating new files, backing up existing ones, and creating parent directories. This tool is essential for managing file content."
- Recommended: "Create new files or completely rewrite existing ones. Auto-creates parent folders and backups. Use file_diff for edits."

**file_diff Tool:**
- Current: "Manages file changes: presents suggestions for user review. This tool is essential for precise file manipulation and collaborative editing workflows."
- Recommended: "Show file change preview with diff visualization. Requires user approval before applying. Preferred for edits and corrections."

**file_move Tool:**
- Current: "Relocates or renames files within the vault, providing options to create necessary directories and handle existing files. This tool is vital for organizing and restructuring content."
- Recommended: "Move or rename files/folders. Auto-creates destination folders. Use for organization and restructuring."

**file_list Tool:**
- Current: "Retrieves a comprehensive list of files and folders within a specified directory, offering options for recursive traversal. This tool is crucial for understanding project structure and navigating the file system."
- Recommended: "List files/folders in directory. Use recursive=true for deep exploration, false for overview. Essential for navigation."

**file_delete Tool:**
- Current: "Safely deletes files or folders from the vault by moving them to a .trash folder (default) or permanently deleting them. The trash option provides safer file management and allows restoration. For folders, creates backups of all contained files before deletion."
- Recommended: "Delete files/folders safely. Moves to .trash by default (recoverable). Creates backups before deletion. Requires confirmation."

**vault_tree Tool:**
- Current: "Generates a hierarchical tree view of the vault structure, showing only folders and their organization in a visual tree format. Perfect for understanding the overall vault organization."
- Recommended: "Generate hierarchical folder tree view. Shows vault organization structure. Use for understanding overall layout."

**get_user_feedback Tool:**
- Current: "Asks the user a question and waits for their response. Supports both text input and multiple choice questions with interactive buttons. Use this when you need user input to proceed with a task."
- Recommended: "Ask user questions with text or multiple choice responses. Pauses execution until answered. Use when user input required."

### 3. Complete Tool Selection Priority Guide

```typescript
TOOL SELECTION PRIORITY & WORKFLOWS:

DISCOVERY & NAVIGATION:
- vault_tree: Overall vault structure and organization
- file_list: Directory contents (recursive for deep exploration)
- file_search: Find files by name/content when location unknown

CONTENT ACCESS:
- file_read: Get current file content before modifications
- get_user_feedback: When user input/decisions needed

CONTENT MODIFICATION:
- file_diff: Edit existing files (preferred - shows preview)
- file_write: Create new files or complete rewrites
- file_move: Organize, rename, or relocate files
- file_delete: Remove files/folders (uses .trash for safety)

COMMON WORKFLOWS:
1. Content Edit: file_read → file_diff → (user approval)
2. File Creation: file_write (with auto-backup)
3. File Discovery: file_search → file_read → file_diff
4. Organization: file_list → file_move/file_delete
5. Structure Review: vault_tree → file_list (specific folders)
6. User Interaction: get_user_feedback → (action based on response)
```

### 4. Parameter Description Standardization

**Standardize parameter descriptions across all tools:**

```typescript
// Common parameter patterns
path: 'File/folder path relative to vault root'
content: 'Complete file content to write'
query: 'Search term (supports regex with useRegex=true)'
recursive: 'Include subdirectories (true) or current level only (false)'
maxResults: 'Maximum items to return (prevents overwhelming output)'
backup: 'Create backup before changes (recommended: true)'
createIfNotExists: 'Create file if missing (default: true)'
useTrash: 'Move to .trash instead of permanent deletion (safer)'
confirmDeletion: 'Required safety confirmation for deletions'
filterType: 'File type filter: "markdown", "image", or "all"'
searchContent: 'Search within file contents (markdown only)'
useRegex: 'Treat query as regular expression'
```
