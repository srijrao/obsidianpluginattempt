## ðŸ”§ Key Integration Points

### Main Plugin Refactoring
```typescript
// Enhanced main.ts integration with new architecture
export default class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
    private initializationManager: InitializationManager;
    private crossCuttingHub: CrossCuttingServicesHub;
    private agentOrchestrator: AgentOrchestrator;
    
    async onload() {
        // Initialize cross-cutting services first
        await this.initializationManager.initializeCore();
        
        // Initialize agent services with cross-cutting integration
        await this.initializationManager.initializeAgentServices();
        
        // Initialize UI and commands
        await this.initializationManager.initializeViews();
        await this.initializationManager.initializeCommands();
    }
}
```

### Cross-Cutting Integration Pattern
```typescript
// Agent services enhanced with cross-cutting concerns
export class EnhancedToolExecutionEngine {
    constructor(
        private logger: ScopedLogger,
        private security: SecurityManager,
        private monitoring: MonitoringService,
        private eventBus: IEventBus
    ) {}
    
    async executeTool(toolConfig: ToolConfig, input: any): Promise<ToolResult> {
        // Security validation
        const validation = await this.security.validateInput(input);
        if (!validation.isValid) {
            throw new SecurityError(validation.issues);
        }
        
        // Performance monitoring
        const timer = this.monitoring.startTimer('tool.execution', toolConfig.name);
        
        try {
            // Execute tool with logging
            this.logger.info('Executing tool', { tool: toolConfig.name, input });
            const result = await this.executeToolImpl(toolConfig, input);
            
            // Sanitize output
            const safeResult = await this.security.sanitizeOutput(result);
            
            timer.end({ success: true });
            return safeResult;
        } catch (error) {
            timer.end({ success: false, error: error.message });
            this.logger.error('Tool execution failed', { tool: toolConfig.name, error });
            throw error;
        }
    }
}
```
